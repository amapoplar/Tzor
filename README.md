## QCD Sum Rules
QCD sum rules is a tools to caculate nonperturtive QCD. It need to caculate lots of Feynmann diagram. And Tzor will help us to simplify caculation procession.

### Why Call me Tzor
Tzor is short for Theorized package of sum rules.
In fact [Tzor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyre,_Lebanon) is a city in Lebanon. Tzor is her Hebrew name. Tzor had destoried and rebuilt during her about 5,000 years city history. Just like our research process, so we named the package as Tzor. 

### How to Use Tzor
To make sure that your notebook can find [_```tzor/tzor.m```_](tzor/tzor.m) just ok.

For example, if your notebook is under same directory with Tzor package.
```Mathematica
Once[Get[NotebookDirectory[] <> "tzor/tzor.m"]]
```
Or you can put fold tzor in your Mathematica ```$UserBaseDirectory``` of Mathematica. If you don't know where, run ```$UserBaseDirectory``` in any notebook. Generally  ```C:\Users\usrname\AppData\Roaming\Mathematica\Applications``` for Windows and ```/home/username/.Mathmatica/Applicatons``` for Ubuntu. 
And use command:

```Mathematica
<<tzor`
```
